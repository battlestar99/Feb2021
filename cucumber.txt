TestNG or Cucumber 

1. organize your code - gherking keywords, annotations 
2. pass/fail - assertion 
3. test report - 
4. test suite - testng xml - java file 
5. data driven testing - test NG xml , data table

TestNG - sequence, parallel 
Cucumber - tags, hooks
cucumber setup: 

1. cucumber eclipse plugin - eclipse market place 
2. cucumber libraries - 10/11 jar files+ selenium 2 jars + TestNG

why: 

1. technical - non technical persons have no understaning 
about what is happening the test - 

BDD - behaviour driven development 

non-technial - manual testing - should be understood by everyone

technical - automation testing 


non-technical - feature file 
technical - step definition file - java class

structure of the feature file - we can have multiple 
test scenerios 

gherkin - gherkin keywords - 5 keywords 

given, when, and,then , but

login test - positive test 

Given user is on the login page 
When user enters right user name
When user enters right password 
Then user should be able to login  

Negative test 

Given user is on the login page
When user entes wrong user name
And user enters wrong password 
Then user should not be able to login 

checking link 

Given user is on the home page
When user clicks on the career page 
Then user should navigate the career page 
When user clicks on the blog page
Then user should be on the blog page




key points to remember: 

1. feature step has to exactly match with annotation parameter

data driven testing: 

Test suite: testrunner 
Tag - testsuite
