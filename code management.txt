Code management - share - and running tests 

Functional Testing >> UI + GUI + web interface testing 
manual
automation >> 70-90 percent 

database -- SQL 
API - postman, soap UI 

TestNG 
  1. package for test scripts 
  2. page object model - object driven 
  3. package utility classes - excel file, database
  4. xml files - test suite = data driven framework 

Cucumber 

  1. feature - data table for data driven framework 
   2. step def 
   3. test runner 
   4. page object model - object driven framework 
   5. utility classes 

Role of different componenent 

Functional Testing: WEB UI 
automation: coding part 
java - as a programming language to write your code 
selenium - browser interaction libary - web application interaction
TestNG/Cucumber - testing library - test organization, test results
test suite, pass/fail scenerio, data driven 

code organization-sharing- running test from remote server 
Maven - build managment system - gradle, ant 
Git/github - version control + code sharing system - bitbucket,svn, gitlab, 
Jenkins - remote server - bamboo, 

what are we doing: 

we are creating test scripts in our local computer
running tests
generating reports 

code is in our local compuer, report is in our local computer
no one can run the test without me, I am running it from my compuer
how multiple automation tester can collaborate with me 

Problems: 

1. for collaboration we need a system where everyone 
can use the same version of the libraries 
2. to share code in a common repository and also control
the version of the code - what changes during the modification

responsiblity of devops 
3. code should be run from remote server also - remote computer



Maven - Build magnagement system - java application 

1. maven takes care of the dependecies / librareis 
2. maven can be connected with a remote server 
3. maven can also create test suite 

Mave structure - 

central repository - in the web mvnrepositoy.com
local repository - in your computer 

pom - project object model 

clean >> cleaning or deleting any temporary file 
install >> install all the dependecies and plugins 
test >> it will run a specific java file which apptest.java
if not specified otherwise 
generate-source > will create a library file for the prject

build >> clean install test 

testNG
TestNG Test - we are running just one file 
TestNG suite - Xml file 

cucumber 
feature - just one feature
testunner - multiple feature 

maven test 

maven - build managment system, dependecny management 
maven test is helping the code to run from remote server

surefire plugin to run test from maven - maven test 
maven install

version control system - 
git - version control and pushing code to the repository 

github - repository - where code is stored 
bitbucket
gitlab
