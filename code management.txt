Code management - share - and running tests 

Functional Testing >> UI + GUI + web interface testing 
manual
automation >> 70-90 percent 

database -- SQL 
API - postman, soap UI 

TestNG 
  1. package for test scripts 
  2. page object model - object driven 
  3. package utility classes - excel file, database
  4. xml files - test suite = data driven framework 

Cucumber 

  1. feature - data table for data driven framework 
   2. step def 
   3. test runner 
   4. page object model - object driven framework 
   5. utility classes 

Role of different componenent 

Functional Testing: WEB UI 
automation: coding part 
java - as a programming language to write your code 
selenium - browser interaction libary - web application interaction
TestNG/Cucumber - testing library - test organization, test results
test suite, pass/fail scenerio, data driven 

code organization-sharing- running test from remote server 
Maven - build managment system - gradle, ant 
Git/github - version control + code sharing system - bitbucket,svn, gitlab, 
Jenkins - remote server - bamboo, 

what are we doing: 

we are creating test scripts in our local computer
running tests
generating reports 

code is in our local compuer, report is in our local computer
no one can run the test without me, I am running it from my compuer
how multiple automation tester can collaborate with me 

Problems: 

1. for collaboration we need a system where everyone 
can use the same version of the libraries 
2. to share code in a common repository and also control
the version of the code - what changes during the modification

responsiblity of devops 
3. code should be run from remote server also - remote computer



Maven - Build magnagement system - java application 

1. maven takes care of the dependecies / librareis 
2. maven can be connected with a remote server 
3. maven can also create test suite 

Mave structure - 

central repository - in the web mvnrepositoy.com
local repository - in your computer 

pom - project object model 

clean >> cleaning or deleting any temporary file 
install >> install all the dependecies and plugins 
test >> it will run a specific java file which apptest.java
if not specified otherwise 
generate-source > will create a library file for the prject

build >> clean install test 

testNG
TestNG Test - we are running just one file 
TestNG suite - Xml file 

cucumber 
feature - just one feature
testunner - multiple feature 

maven test 

maven - build managment system, dependecny management 
maven test is helping the code to run from remote server

surefire plugin to run test from maven - maven test 
maven install

version control system - 
git - version control and pushing code to the repository 

github - repository - where code is stored 
bitbucket
gitlab


error >> code syntax has to be right 

run time error >> 

git and github - 

local repository - 
remote repository - github

1. making a local repository in your compuer
2. connect the local repository to a remote repositoy

java- programming language 

selenium- web UI testing 
res-assured - API testing
JDBC - database testing 

cucumber- testNg >> testing library 

basic responsibilties of the automation tester? 

QA Analyst - 
manual tester - 
automation tester- qa enginner - automation testing
SDET - highly automation tester 

manual tester - creating and executing test cases only manually
automation tester - creating and executing test cases
manually and with automated test script

responsibilities : 

1. analyze requirement - 
converting manual test cases to automated test scripts 
user stories >> come up with scenerios>> create the test scripts

- run the test scripts in your local computer
- push the code to the company repository - 

system admin - devOps - manage the github of the company
create a github account using your company email - then devops
people will give you access to the specific project / repository

connect the remote with the local and start pushing code 



environment setup>> jdk+eclipse+ project(maven project) 
 cucumebr or testng >> plugins with eclipse 
 create a maven project >> setup the pom.xml 
 + add depencies - selenium, testng, cucumber
 + add plugins - surefire plugin, maven compiler 

maven is a replacement of creating a java project 
maven is basically a type of java project > 
jenkins is the remote server 

git/github 

push - uploading your updated code from local 
pull - downloading updated code from remote 


Jenkins - remote server - CI/CD pipeline 

contineous integration and contineous development pipeline 

when you should do your test or run your test? 

deploying our code - code deployment 

dev server - testers dont do anything
192.168.2.2 - dev.agileteach.com
test server - regression
192.168.2.1
regression.agileteach.com

uat - staging 
192.168.2.3
release - production 
192.168.2.4 >> www.agileteach.com

code freeze - 

CI/CD - remote server will do the work - jenkins 

devops - system 

developer is writing code - pushing it to the github - and then
deploy it to a server

testers are running the test code and generating the result 

1. try to finish homework - 
2. understand how you are going to explain - 

TestNG annotations - parameterization xml 

java - functions/methods
selenium
cucumber - 
testng - annotations - 

tags - 

@regressionRun
@omit
@datadriven

(enable=false)


maven-git/github - jenkins 

hands on practice on the class -
